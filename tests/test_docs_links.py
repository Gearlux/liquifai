"""The documentation's internal links resolve.

A dead docs link is the kind of rot nobody notices until a reader hits one, and
it is created by exactly the ordinary edits this project does constantly: renaming
a heading, splitting a page, moving a section between guides. Nothing else checks
it — CI runs the test suite and the examples, and a broken `[text](other.md#x)`
breaks neither.

Three rules, one per failure mode:

* a relative link names a file that exists,
* an `#anchor` names a heading that exists in that file,
* README links are absolute GitHub blob URLs, because the README doubles as the
  PyPI landing page where relative links do not resolve.

Fenced code blocks are excluded from the scan — see :func:`_strip_code`.

The CI workflow is generated and must not be hand-edited, so these live as tests
— which is also where they belong: they run locally on the same command.
